Next (in order of descending priority):
-look into bootstrap
 --if this works out, do release 1.1
-background music (e.g. "Barrel Blast"); choice
-release 2.0 (or 1.2)
-basic (perhaps, stupid) AI
-release 3.0
-make wireless choice a radio button, so menu no longer has invisible
 parts
-applying stepwise refinement in more areas
 (perhaps a function for changing the webpage that takes the context)
 --consider the phases of the webpage
  ---consider using objects to manage these phases
 --organize functions handling user interaction (e.g. remove the
   enableResponsesToKeyPresses function)
-Node.js
-release 4.0
-YouTube video

Considerable:
-precondition checks for functions with boolean argument (since an
 undefined argument is neither true nor false)
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
 (contract may be sufficient); notify in console
-consider whether or not it's practical to enforce preconditions in unit
 tests (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
