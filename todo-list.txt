For next release:

-write an application dictionary (in a language Git Bash can run)
--(e.g. define "contract")
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed?
-make webpages look appealing (e.g. CSS)
-implement PHP security?
-consider whether or not its practical to enforce preconditions in unit tests
 (as opposed to solely with exceptions)

For README:

 on how to enable that hook
-include directions for the shell scripts and batch file(s)
-include directions regarding unit tests
-include directions for running the project (on WebMatrix)
-note how contracts are enforced (unit tests, exceptions and alerts, etc.)
