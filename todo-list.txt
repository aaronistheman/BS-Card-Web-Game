Next (in order of descending priority):
-change name of enableResponsesToKeyPresses function
-change game so that it only focuses on one human player's viewpoint
-basic (perhaps, stupid) AI
  -create radio button for choice
  -make waitForPlayer() optional; replace with delay, so humans can
   see computers' moves
  -each AI is either honest, or plays one to three cards that are a
   lie
  -each AI difficulty has a different chance of calling BS
  -(if needed) applying stepwise refinement in more areas
   (perhaps a function for changing the webpage that takes the context)
   --consider the phases of the webpage
    ---consider using objects to manage these phases
   --organize functions handling user interaction
-release 3.0
-make wireless choice a radio button, so menu no longer has invisible
 parts
-Node.js
-release 4.0
-YouTube video

Considerable:
-precondition checks for functions with boolean argument (since an
 undefined argument is neither true nor false)
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
 (contract may be sufficient); notify in console
-consider whether or not it's practical to enforce preconditions in unit
 tests (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
