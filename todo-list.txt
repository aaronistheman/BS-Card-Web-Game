Next:
-make center pile
-turn taking
-fix acceptable number of players (can't have 1 player)
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
-default values for object parameters?
-consider determining who goes first either based on who has ace of spades
 or based on the order in which the cards were dealt (for fairness)

For next release:
-allow the user to use arrow keys on the menu?
-write an application dictionary (in a language Git Bash can run)
--(e.g. define "contract")
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed?
-make webpages look appealing (e.g. CSS)
-implement PHP security?
-consider whether or not its practical to enforce preconditions in unit tests
 (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-make readme

For README:
-note the use of the hook regarding trailing whitespace; include directions
 on how to enable that hook
-include directions for the shell scripts and batch file(s)
-include directions regarding unit tests
-include directions for running the project (on WebMatrix)
-note how contracts are enforced (unit tests, exceptions and alerts, etc.)

Other:
-use a saboteur (i.e. me) to test my testing (see p.244 of "The
 Pragmatic Programmer")
