Next (in order of descending priority):
-delay between start of turn and AI's picking move
-let user choose a move
-fix ability to call BS
    --check for win after a call
    --game should be like the following from a single viewpoint:
    --someone submits cards
    --if someone calls BS, it'll be announced and resolved (with delays
      and maybe animations, so the human can see)
    --switch turn (but not viewpoint), and repeat the above two steps
    --update dislay of user's cards if user gets the center pile (and
      when he submits cards, which is alredy done)
-remove no longer needed functions (e.g. waitForPlayer())
-remove no longer needed webpage elements; reorganize webpage
-different AI skill
-remove use of alerts

After the above:
-release 3.0
-make wireless choice a radio button, so menu no longer has invisible
 parts
-Node.js
-release 4.0
-YouTube video

Considerable:
-precondition checks for functions with boolean argument (since an
 undefined argument is neither true nor false)
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
 (contract may be sufficient); notify in console
-consider whether or not it's practical to enforce preconditions in unit
 tests (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
