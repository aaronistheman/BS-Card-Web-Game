Next (in order of descending priority):

After game functions without graphics:
-include directions on how to play the game
-release v0.1
-in settings, player can choose whether to use GUI or not
 --store result in either local or session storage
-graphics (CSS and images)
-Node.js

Considerable:
-precondition checks for functions with boolean argument (since an
 undefined argument is neither true nor false)
-use a saboteur (i.e. me) to test my testing (see p.244 of "The
 Pragmatic Programmer")
-don't have functions use the value they're changing as parameters
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
 (contract may be sufficient)
-consider support for both use of keys and use of clicking
-implement PHP security
-consider whether or not its practical to enforce preconditions in unit tests
 (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
-consider performance issues (e.g. with function append())
-modules for unit tests (e.g. based on which file each function is in)
-AI
-applying stepwise refinement in more areas
-play a sound when a player is asked to check in
