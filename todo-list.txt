Next (in order of descending priority):
-see if there is a better way to organize the parts of a stylesheet
 by which file they affect (e.g. through document-wrapping id's)
-consider using Angular to generate radio button for each stylesheet
 in main menu (is this efficient?)
-make everything look nice
 --consider dealing with the formerly problematic overlap regarding the
   submission display
 --consider making at least four different styles (e.g. perhaps one
   that uses bg.jpg)
-readme
-release 1.0
-look into bootstrap
 --if this works out, do release 1.1
-play a sound when a player is asked to check in
-background music (e.g. "Barrel Blast"); choice
-applying stepwise refinement in more areas
 (perhaps a function for changing the webpage that takes the context)
 --consider the phases of the webpage
  ---consider using objects to manage these phases
 --organize functions handling user interaction (e.g. remove the
   enableResponsesToKeyPresses function)
-add unit tests to some functions that don't have any

After the above:
-release 2.0
-basic (perhaps, stupid) AI
-release 3.0
-Node.js
-release 4.0
-YouTube video

Considerable:
-precondition checks for functions with boolean argument (since an
 undefined argument is neither true nor false)
-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed
-checking for providing of arguments to functions that require it
 (contract may be sufficient); notify in console
-consider support for both use of keys and use of clicking
-consider whether or not its practical to enforce preconditions in unit
 tests (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
