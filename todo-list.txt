-use strict equal in QUnit
-graphics (CSS and images)
  ---applying stepwise refinement in more areas
-play a sound when a player is asked to check in

-figure out how to not allow a commit if unit tests failed

-consider support for both use of keys and use of clicking
-consider whether or not its practical to enforce preconditions in unit
 tests (as opposed to solely with exceptions)
-look into generating tests automatically
-CSS variables
